# RAIL Model

RAIL is a user-centric performance model that breaks down the user's experience into key actions.

Aspects of RAIL
* Response
* Animation
* Idle
* Load

### Goals and guidelines
In the context of RAIL, the terms goals and guidelines have specific meanings:

Goals. Key performance metrics related to user experience. Since human perception is relatively constant, these goals are unlikely to change any time soon.
Guidelines. Recommendations that help you achieve goals. These may be specific to current hardware and network connection conditions, and therefore may change over time.
Focus on the user
Make users the focal point of your performance effort.
