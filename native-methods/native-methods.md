### Native Methods
No matter how optimal your JavaScript code is, it will never be faster than the native methods provided by the JavaScript engine. The reason for this is simple: the native parts of JavaScript—those already present in the browser before you write a line of code—are all written in a lower-level language such as C++. That means these methods are compiled down to machine code as part of the browser and therefore don’t have the same limitations as your JavaScript code.
