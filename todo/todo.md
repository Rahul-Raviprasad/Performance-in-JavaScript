1. caches pdf and tiffs[both single tiff with multiple pages & multiple tiff files for a task]. User once visited a page will cache and revisiting to the same page would fetch from javascript cache instead a call to server.
2.  https://github.com/leff/angular-pdf-viewer plugin earlier which doesn't support caching and asynchronous calls. how that can be improved?
